* 1.1.1 - Nov 15 2018

- Bump version to 1.1.1 to move beyond whomever took my project, changed themselves to be the author and stuck it on pypi.


* 1.1.0 - Nov 15 2018

- Fix issue when literal \n (a backslash and an n) appeared in the output.

- Fix where newline and carriage return in output format wasn't being respected.

- Fix some escaping issues


* 1.0.0 - Nov 19 2016
- Add setup.py, MANIFEST.in, README.rst to prepare for pypi distribution
- Expand READMEs to contain a lot more info, better formatting, etc
- Greatly expand usage (and include expanded version in the READMEs) which go
in-depth on usage, and where to find more information on writing the
expressions.
- Rename arguments to be more clear, and associated variables.
- Change what happens when ${0} is provided, or no "Output Format" is
provided: before it printed the entire line when matched. This is what grep
already does, so it has no additional value.
 Instead, it now prints just the matched section (from start of provided regex
 to end of matched zone)

- Only accept group names which start with a-z, A-Z, or _ (i.e. don't allow
0-9 at start). It's not supported anyway, and conflicts with group
enumeration.
- Move version info into a function, and include version info and author at
bottom of "usage" (--help).
- Do not implicitly load .* in front of most patterns, instead use a better
way of regex searching which supports the match starting at any point in the
chain.

* 0.2.0 - Nov 03 2016
- Add missing tab that was messing up formatting
- Update and expand README to contain more examples and such
- For groups that are not matched (like those contained only within a
conditional "OR", for example), replace the value with an empty string. This
prevents trying to insert "None" if referenced in the output string.
- When a regex fails to parse and we have enough information, output the RE
and an error pointing to the location of the error (followed by the error
message itself)
- Fix some typos

* 0.1.0 - Sep 12 2016
- Initial Release
